# Architecture Decision Records

This directory tracks the architectural decisions for `git-ai-studio`. Each ADR follows the
Michael Nygard format (Context / Options / Decision / Consequences) and cites the real
production precedents that informed the call.

## Guiding principles

These ADRs were written under the constraints that ship with this project:

1. **Mature first.** Prefer boring, battle-tested libraries over the newest thing on Hacker News.
2. **No deprecated paths.** Anything flagged "deprecated" by its maintainer is rejected outright,
   even if it still works today.
3. **No tech for tech's sake.** A 50-line hand-rolled helper beats a 50KB dependency when the
   helper covers everything the product actually needs.
4. **Bundle weight matters.** This is a desktop app that ships with the binary; users do not
   re-download on every visit, but slow startup is still a UX tax.
5. **Cross-platform.** macOS + Linux + Windows must all stay first-class.
6. **OSS / MIT only.** No license traps.

Where an ADR cites a peer project (e.g. `cc-switch`, `GitButler`, `Spacedrive`,
`Hoppscotch`), the URL is included so the reasoning is auditable.
