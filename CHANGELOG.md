# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Version bumps are manual — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing-a-new-version-maintainer-only) and [ADR-008](docs/adr/0008-conventional-commits-release-tool.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- "Fix this" for an individual agent now re-probes after running `git-ai install` and reports an honest failure (with the real reason) instead of always reporting success.
- Codex diagnostics now detect legacy `~/.codex/hooks.json` hooks and explain that inline `config.toml` hooks require git-ai 1.4.8+ (the release that migrated Codex to inline TOML), guiding the user to upgrade git-ai instead of silently staying red.
- The Install page no longer disables "Install / Upgrade to latest" when the GitHub Releases API is unreachable (rate-limited or blocked); the official install script resolves the latest version on its own.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Desktop companion ("Ink pet"): fixed the transparent window rendering a black background and a stray scrollbar (mark the window before mount + flatten the layout with declarative CSS).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Hook detection for two more AI agents — **Gemini** and **Pi** (backend probes plus frontend status), bringing the agent matrix to six.

### Changed

- Line-level Blame is now part of commit attribution: per-line authorship opens as a drill-down dialog instead of a separate route (see [ADR-013](docs/adr/0013-blame-into-commit-attribution.md)).
- Completed bilingual (Simplified Chinese / English) i18n across the remaining pages — Diagnostics, Dashboard, Commits, Settings, People, Notes, and the repo setup guide.
- Streamlined the Diagnostics page to a health-first layout (dropped the summary card and the raw-report drawer) and trimmed the Settings / People / Notes headers into click-to-reveal info.
- The sidebar footer version is now read at runtime instead of being hardcoded, so it can no longer drift.

### Fixed

- The desktop pet's right-click menu and hover bubble now follow the main window's language (language is carried in the one-way pet-state stream).
- `git-ai debug` is no longer invoked with the `report` sub-argument that upstream removed (it was being rejected).
- An empty checkpoint set under the current HEAD is treated as a normal empty state (neutral info) instead of being flagged as an actionable problem.

### Removed

- The login-state diagnostic check — the local tool does not require login.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Desktop companion ("Ink pet") — an opt-in (default off), always-on-top floating widget that renders your live AI-authorship rate as a two-tone ink ball: purple ink (AI) on the outer ring, blue ink (you) at the core, so the shape *is* the data (color + position dual-encoded, colorblind-readable). Ships 3 built-in themes and a hover bubble; only the daemon-unhealthy state may raise an OS notification. See [ADR-011](docs/adr/0011-desktop-companion-ink-pet.md).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Initial open-source release: a local desktop dashboard for AI code authorship, built on top of the [`git-ai`](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai) CLI.
- Views: Dashboard, Commits (per-commit stats), People (per-author), Blame (line-level), git notes, Checkpoints.
- Official `git ai install-hooks` integration for Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / OpenCode.
- Bilingual UI (Simplified Chinese / English) via i18next, with an in-app language switcher.
- macOS (universal `.dmg`), Linux (`.AppImage` + `.deb`, x86_64 + ARM64), and Windows (`.msi`) builds.
- OS-native notifications (via `tauri-plugin-notification`) for low AI-share and daemon-health alerts — opt-in, no webhook, no cloud.
- `refs/notes/ai` fetch/push sync through the upstream CLI.

### Changed

- UI restyled to a Linear-inspired minimal aesthetic on Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui.

### Removed

- Self-hosted hook server (Windows scheduled task + VBS shim + Node HTTP server). Hooks now go exclusively through the official `git ai install-hooks`.
- Feishu webhook push (replaced by OS-native notifications).
