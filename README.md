## What it is

git-ai-studio turns your local git history into a live picture of human-versus-AI authorship. It reads the `refs/notes/ai` written by the [`git-ai`](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai) CLI — every Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or OpenCode edit is already on disk, line for line — and renders it as a dashboard you can open when you want to know: today's AI share, which files an agent touched last night, and a `git blame` where each row is tinted by the model that wrote it.

Until now you either trusted vendor dashboards that count keystrokes inside their own IDE, or you wrote spreadsheets from `git log`. **git-ai-studio shows you what actually landed in `main`, parsed entirely on your machine — the only thing it sends is a single version check to GitHub at launch (no telemetry, no account, no crash reporter).**

See [`docs/product/PR-FAQ.md`](docs/product/PR-FAQ.md) for the full positioning and FAQ.

## Why now

- [Stack Overflow 2025](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai/) (n=49k): **51% of professional developers use AI coding tools daily**
- [Sonar State of Code 2026](https://www.sonarsource.com/state-of-code-developer-survey-report.pdf): **26.9% of production code is AI-authored**, up from 22% the prior quarter
- Most teams now run *more than one* agent (Claude Code + Cursor + Codex is a common stack) — vendor-specific dashboards see only their own keystrokes
- `git-ai` shipped a stable v3 spec for `refs/notes/ai`, giving a vendor-neutral substrate to read from

## Features

- **Dashboard** — repository-level AI share, hook coverage, recent commits at a glance
- **Stats** — per-commit detail with tool/model breakdown (Claude Sonnet vs Cursor vs Codex …)
- **People** — per-author AI contribution over a rolling window
- **Blame** — file-level, line-by-line: who wrote it, which model, via which prompt
- **Checkpoints / Notes** — inspect raw `refs/notes/ai` payloads from the AI agents
- **Hooks / Diagnostic** — install official `git-ai` hooks for your agent in one click; diagnose env in one screen
- **Desktop pet** (opt-in, off by default) — an ink-drop companion in a screen corner whose two-tone blend mirrors your live AI share, and that shifts shape when the hook is missing, a commit fails to tag, or the daemon gets stuck. _Known limits:_ the transparent overlay needs a compositor on Linux and may fall back to opaque on older Windows WebView2 builds; selective click-through is deferred to a later release. See [ADR-011](docs/adr/0011-desktop-companion-ink-pet.md).

All parsing happens locally. No account, no telemetry, no crash reporter — just a single version-number check to GitHub at launch (turn it off with `plugins.updater.active=false`).

## Quick start

> Pre-alpha. Release binaries are not yet published. Build from source:

```bash
# Requirements: Node 20+, pnpm 9+, Rust 1.80+, git-ai CLI installed
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

Once binaries ship via GitHub Releases, install will be:

- **macOS**: download `.dmg`, drag to Applications
- **Linux**: download `.AppImage` (universal) or `.deb` (Debian / Ubuntu)
- **Windows**: download `.msi` — v1.0 is unsigned, bypass SmartScreen manually (code-signing tracked for v1.1)

Then point the app at any git repository with `refs/notes/ai`. If the repo has no notes yet, follow the in-app Hooks guide to install official `git-ai` hooks for your agent (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / OpenCode); your next AI-assisted commit appears live.

## Status

**Pre-alpha**. PR-FAQ is locked, refactor in progress, first public release (v0.1) tracked in [project issues](../../issues). Three things must happen before v1.0:

1. 3 real user interviews validating the daily-glance assumption (see [PR-FAQ](docs/product/PR-FAQ.md))
2. 4-week local opt-in usage-counter readout from 5 friends
3. Architecture decisions in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) accepted by maintainers

## Relationship to `usegitai.com`

git-ai-studio is an **independent open-source project, not affiliated with the Git AI commercial team**. We consume only the open-source `git-ai` CLI and the public `refs/notes/ai` standard. [Git AI Teams / Cloud](https://usegitai.com) is an org-level SaaS dashboard sold to VPs of Engineering; this is a single-developer local desktop client — different surface, different buyer. If upstream releases an official desktop GUI, we will reassess scope. See [FAQ #6](docs/product/PR-FAQ.md) for the full statement.

## Privacy

100% local. No account creation, no telemetry, no crash reporter. The one automatic network call is a single version-number check to GitHub about a second after launch — it sends no code, no repository data, no personal data, only a version number, so you don't silently miss security fixes; if a newer version exists you can install it in one click (minisign-verified). You can turn this check off entirely by building with `plugins.updater.active=false`. Every other outbound call is one you explicitly trigger: `git-ai` install/upgrade from GitHub Releases, and optional `git push refs/notes/ai` to your own remote. See [ADR-010](docs/adr/0010-in-app-auto-update.md) for the rationale.
